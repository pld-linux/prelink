# This config file contains a list of directories both with binaries
# and libraries prelink should consider by default.
# If a directory name is prefixed with `-l ', the directory hierarchy
# will be walked as long as filesystem boundaries are not crossed.
# If a directory name is prefixed with `-h ', symbolic links in a
# directory hierarchy are followed.
# Directories or files with `-b ' prefix will be blacklisted.
